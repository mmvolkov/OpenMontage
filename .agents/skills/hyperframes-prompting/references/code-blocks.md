# Code animations

_Prompt code walkthroughs — typing, diffing, highlighting, scrolling — and pick a terminal or editor theme by name._

<!-- Vendored from heygen-com/hyperframes docs/prompting/code-blocks.mdx — canonical: https://hyperframes.heygen.com/prompting/code-blocks -->

Your PR video from Level 1 named `code-diff` for a single beat and moved on. This chapter is the rest of that catalog: typing, diffing, highlighting, scrolling, and picking a terminal or editor theme by name — for the moments a walkthrough needs to slow down and let the code itself carry the scene.

Code is the one subject where the framework does the hard part for you. The [Code Animations](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/code-typing) blocks handle syntax highlighting, caret tracking, diff coloring, and camera moves deterministically — you describe the *walkthrough*, name the block, and paste your snippet. This page is the vocabulary for doing that well; for turning a real pull request into a code-change video, see [Code and PRs](code-and-prs.md).

Everything here follows the [one-shot skeleton](anatomy.md): route, spec, beats, copy, technique, negatives. The "technique" slot is where you name the block, and the "copy" slot is where your code goes — quoted exactly, because unquoted code gets paraphrased into something that won't compile.

### Pick the motion by what the viewer should learn

Each Code Animations block answers a different "what is the viewer supposed to notice." Map the intent to the block:

| You want to show…                          | Name this block                                         | Length |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Code being written, character by character | [`code-typing`](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/code-typing)            | 5s     |
| An edit — before → after, red/green        | [`code-diff`](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/code-diff)                | 6s     |
| One line as *the* line, everything else dim | [`code-highlight`](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/code-highlight)      | 5s     |
| Walking a long file to a spot deep inside  | [`code-scroll`](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/code-scroll)            | 6s     |
| One snippet transforming into another      | [`code-morph`](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/code-morph)              | 7s     |
| Code on a rotating 3D slab (title-card feel) | [`code-3d-extrude`](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/code-3d-extrude)    | 8s     |
| Code resolving out of a shader dissolve    | [`code-shader-dissolve`](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/code-shader-dissolve) | 7s |
| Code assembling from a particle swarm      | [`code-particle-assemble`](https://hyperframes.heygen.com/catalog/blocks/code-particle-assemble) | 8s |

The first four are the workhorses of a code *walkthrough* — they keep the code readable and the viewer oriented. Everything below them trades legibility for motion: they look great as an opener or a hero moment, but they trade legibility for motion, so don't ask them to carry an explanation.

> **Tip:**
> `code-morph` re-drives Shiki Magic Move as a paused GSAP timeline, and `code-diff` collapses removed lines and expands added lines. Both read "an edit happened" far more clearly than retyping the whole snippet with `code-typing` — reach for them when the story is *a change*, not *authoring from scratch*.

### Prompting a typing reveal

`code-typing` reveals code character by character with a caret that tracks the frontier — no CSS animation, so it seeks cleanly. Give it the exact code and a pace; the agent re-bakes the block's syntax tokens to your snippet.

> /motion-graphics 6-second 1920x1080 video. A dark editor types this snippet, character by character, caret tracking the frontier, then holds on the blinking cursor for the final second:
> ```
> export async function render(comp: Composition) {
>   await comp.seek(0);
>   return comp.capture();
> }
> ```
> Use the `code-typing` registry block. No narration, no image or media files.

**Quote the code as a literal block.** Prose descriptions of code get paraphrased.
- ❌ `type out a function that seeks to zero and captures`
- ✅ paste the actual snippet in a fenced block — it renders verbatim

**Give the caret somewhere to rest.** Compositions hold their final state, so if you don't ask for a hold the last frame is a frozen full snippet — the [dead-motion tell](motion.md).
- ❌ `types the code and ends`
- ✅ `types the code, then holds on the blinking cursor for the final second`

### Prompting a diff or a highlight

For "here's what changed," hand `code-diff` the before and after and let it color the delta. For "look at *this* line," give `code-highlight` the full context and name the target line.

> /motion-graphics 6-second 1920x1080 video. Show this edit to `api.ts` as a colored diff — the removed line collapses in red, the added line expands in green:
> removed: `const res = await fetch(url)`
> added: `const res = await fetch(url, { signal })`
> Use the `code-diff` registry block. No audio.

*Rendered from the prompt above, unedited.*

> /motion-graphics 5-second 1920x1080 video. Show a 12-line config file; a highlight band sweeps to line 7 (`timeout: 30_000`) while the surrounding lines dim. Hold with line 7 lit and the cursor blinking. Use the `code-highlight` registry block. No audio.

*Rendered from the prompt above, unedited — the agent authors plausible surrounding config lines; paste all 12 if the exact file matters.*

**Name the target line unambiguously.** The block dims context around one line — tell it which.
- ❌ `highlight the important line`
- ✅ `highlight line 7 (timeout: 30_000)`

### Prompting a scroll-through

`code-scroll` moves the camera down a long file to bring a target line to center and spotlights it — the block for walking real modules, not toy snippets.

> /motion-graphics 6-second 1920x1080 video. Scroll a ~60-line source file so line 44 (`return dedupeFrames(frames)`) arrives at center and gets spotlighted; ease the scroll and let it settle without snapping. Use the `code-scroll` registry block. No audio.

[▶ HyperFrames video: Code Scroll](https://static.heygen.ai/hyperframes-oss/docs/images/prompting/code-scroll.mp4)
*Rendered from the prompt above, unedited.*

**Ask the scroll to ease and settle, not snap.** A linear scroll that stops dead reads mechanical.
- ❌ `scroll straight to the line`
- ✅ `ease the scroll and let it settle` — pair with the [motion grammar](motion.md)

### Choosing a theme by name

| Profile      | Block                                     | Profile        | Block                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |

**VS Code workbench themes** — full editor chrome (activity bar, sidebar, tabs, terminal, status bar). Say "monokai" or "visual studio dark":

| Say this               | Block                                 | Say this            | Block                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |

[▶ HyperFrames video: Terminal Ocean](https://static.heygen.ai/hyperframes-oss/docs/images/prompting/terminal-ocean.mp4)
*Rendered from the prompt above, unedited.*

**Match the theme to the surface you're claiming to show.** A terminal command in a VS Code editor chrome reads wrong; a source file in Terminal.app reads wrong.
- ❌ `monokai theme typing a shell command`
- ✅ `apple terminal homebrew profile typing a shell command`

> **Tip:**
> Ambiguity resolves to the closest named block. "Dark theme" is under-specified — the agent picks one of a dozen dark variants and you may not get the one you pictured. Say the theme name. This is the [specification dial](specification-dial.md) applied to code: name the block when the default choice can miss.

### Pairing with a pull request

When the code you're animating comes from a real PR, don't hand-write the beats — the [`/pr-to-video`](code-and-prs.md) workflow reads the diff and composes `code-diff`, `code-highlight`, and `code-scroll` around the actual changed hunks. Use the blocks on this page directly when you're illustrating a concept; route through the PR workflow when you're narrating a specific change set.

> **Note:**
> **Capstone thread** — the [Level 7 film](capstone.md) opens with this chapter's technique: real HyperFrames markup typed character by character, and the typed line's baseline literally grows into the timeline wire the rest of the film travels (cut from the film, below).

This is the clause in the [full capstone prompt](capstone.md#the-prompt-word-for-word) that buys the piece — prompt language you can lift for your own video:

> **Type (0–7s).** Black-on-charcoal close-up: a cursor types real HyperFrames markup character by character — `` and a `gsap.timeline({ paused: true })` line. As the typed line completes, the text's baseline extends and becomes **the wire** — the underline literally grows into the timeline and the camera begins its dolly along it. The typed div folds into a compact clip chip (persistent element 3) that drops onto the wire. Kinetic display type states "WRITE HTML." as the travel begins.
